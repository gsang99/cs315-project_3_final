# cs315-project_3_final

////Collaboration and sources I talked with multiple of my classmates for help and had chat gpt explain to me what all the functions goals were. I also used geeks for geeks a lot and stack overflow, helped a lot to understand the huffman tree. 

//Implementation details Learning the map stuff was annoying and creating the actuall huffman tree was a horrifying, degrading stressful process, but i am here now

////Testing status It works kind of? I can get out my bst stuff now, which wasnt happening in part 2 and fixd all of my files and constructors from part 2 which was so not fun. However, my files are very specific in the way they want things tested and I was trying to do some last minute testing and I gave up because I needed to turn this in on time. Hopefully, everything gets populated properly, I think my input output file folder was placed in the wrong spot.
